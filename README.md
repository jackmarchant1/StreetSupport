## Introduction
With the accelerating move towards digital transactions, the homeless community faces challenges in receiving direct monetary aid as cash donations decline. This project introduces a novel platform aimed at addressing this gap, providing a secure and accessible means for the homeless to receive monetary support in today's cashless environment.

## Features

- **Unique Codes for Homeless Individuals:** Each homeless person receives a short, randomized code, allowing them to garner support without needing a mobile device.
  
- **Simple Donation Process for Supporters:** Supporters can enter the provided code on the dedicated website, donating through popular payment platforms like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal.

- **Integration with Partnering Charity:** Collaborative effort with a charitable organization that helps distribute unique codes and corresponding debit cards to homeless beneficiaries. These cards offer an avenue for beneficiaries to utilize received funds.

## Security & Privacy

My utmost priority with the project is to ensure the safety, security, and privacy of both donors and recipients. Comprehensive details on the measures in place will be shared here as the platform develops.

## Ethical Considerations

This project does not merely revolve around software development. I am deeply committed to understanding and addressing the broader ethical implications, ensuring the platform remains transparent, trustworthy, and respectful of all its users.

## Project Status

- **Complete:** Prototype fully developed. Feedback gathered from potential donors and local homeless charity ambassadors. Project achieved a first class mark.


## Future Enhancements

Feedback from the homeless charity ambassadors and potential donor users through feedback forms and interviews indicated some key areas to explore should the project progress. These include:
- Implement account creation ability for donors, allowing them to check past donations and keep track of how members they have donated to are doing,
- Allow charity ambassadors to post messages to member's pages,

## Contributing

I am yet to decide about contributions to this project and it will rely largely on what is allowed by university guidelines. If you'd like to contribute, please check back soon for guidelines on how you can make a difference.

By marrying computer science with social impact, I aim to foster a significant positive change in the lives of homeless individuals worldwide during this project.
