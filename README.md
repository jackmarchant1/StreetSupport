## Introduction
With the accelerating move towards digital transactions, the homeless community faces challenges in receiving direct monetary aid as cash donations decline. This project introduces a novel platform aimed at addressing this gap, providing a secure and accessible means for the homeless to receive monetary support in today's cashless environment.

## Features

- **Unique Codes for Homeless Individuals:** Each homeless person receives a short, randomized code, allowing them to garner support without needing a mobile device.
  
- **Simple Donation Process for Supporters:** Supporters can enter the provided code on the dedicated website, donating through popular payment platforms like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal.

- **Integration with Partnering Charity:** Collaborative effort with a charitable organization that helps distribute unique codes and corresponding debit cards to homeless beneficiaries. These cards offer an avenue for beneficiaries to utilize received funds.

## Usage

(To be updated as the project progresses.)

## Security & Privacy

My utmost priority with the project is to ensure the safety, security, and privacy of both donors and recipients. Comprehensive details on the measures in place will be shared here as the platform develops.

## Ethical Considerations

This project does not merely revolve around software development. I am deeply committed to understanding and addressing the broader ethical implications, ensuring the platform remains transparent, trustworthy, and respectful of all its users.

## Project Status

- **Development Phase:** Pre-implementation

Stay tuned for regular updates as the project progresses!

## Future Enhancements

The project is currently in the initial stages and I eagerly look forward to evolving it based on user feedback and technological advances. Planned enhancements and new features will be listed here.

## Contributing

I am yet to decide about contributions to this project and it will rely largely on what is allowed by university guidelines. If you'd like to contribute, please check back soon for guidelines on how you can make a difference.

## Feedback & Adoption Rates

I will closely monitor the platform's effectiveness and gather feedback from both homeless individuals and donors. Insights and statistics will be updated here.
